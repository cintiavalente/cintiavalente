- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Cintia Matos, and I am currently working as an Oracle EPM consultant. Oracle EPM stands for Enterprise Performance Management,
  and it involves analyzing and improving a company's performance through advanced technological solutions.
  As an Oracle EPM consultant, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects, helping organizations streamline their financial planning and reporting processes,
  optimize their budget allocations, and enhance their overall decision-making capabilities.
  However, in my pursuit of professional growth and personal development, I believe in continuously expanding my skillset and exploring new technological horizons.
  With this belief in mind, I have recently embarked on a journey to learn new programming languages and broaden my knowledge in different areas within the technology sector.
  In conclusion, as an Oracle EPM consultant, I have had the privilege of working with cutting-edge technologies that enhance business performance. However,
  I am committed to expanding my skillset and exploring new areas within the technology sector.
